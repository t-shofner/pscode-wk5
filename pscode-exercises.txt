// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
if the number is divisible by 2
   print on the screen “Even” 
else
   print on the screen “Odd”


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Ask for 5 separate numbers 
// For the exercise, the supposed numbers will be labeled: num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
Add the 5 numbers together
Divide the sum of those numbers by 5 to determine the average
Set avg to the determined average

// Solve for maximum (max)
If num1 is less than num2
Set max to num2 
Else 
Set max to num1 
If num3 is greater than max  
Set max to num3 
If num4 is greater than max 
Set max to num4 
If num5 is greater than max 
Set max to num5

// Solve for minimum (min)
If num1 is greater than num2
   Set min to num2 
Else 
   Set min to num1 
If num3 is less than min  
   Set min to num3 
If num4 is less than min 
   Set min to num4 
If num5 is less than min 
   Set min to num5


Print on the screen "The average is (avg)."
Print on the screen "The smallest number is (min)." 
print on the screen "The largest number is (max)."
